Achieved First Milestone for HandMeUp - A Buy & Sell Platform for JNU!



I'm thrilled to announce that stage one of HandMeUp, a buy and sell website for JNU students, is now complete! ðŸŽ‰ Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, this platform aims to provide a convenient and secure way for our university community to buy and sell items.



In this initial stage, I have successfully implemented:



- User authentication and registration

- Product listing with images, descriptions, and pricing

- Search and filter functionality for easy product discovery

- Contact seller directly on Whatsapp
